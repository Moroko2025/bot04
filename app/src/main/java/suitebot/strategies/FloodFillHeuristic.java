/**
 * Flood Fill Heuristic for Tron-like game
 *
 * Flood Fill is a simple but effective algorithm used to evaluate how much free space a bot can potentially occupy from its current position. It is commonly used in pathfinding and area estimation problems.
 *
 * Key Ideas:
 * It simulates expansion from the botâ€™s position.
 * A queue-based approach (BFS) is used to explore free squares.
 * The number of reachable squares is counted.
 * The process is repeated for each possible move direction to estimate which move leads to the largest open area.
 * How the algorithm works in the code:
 * Iterate over all possible directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
 *
 * Determine the bot's next position.
 * If the position is free, run the flood fill algorithm.
 * Flood Fill exploration:
 *
 * A queue (BFS approach) is used to expand from the given position.
 * All reachable free squares are counted while avoiding obstacles.
 * The search can be limited to a max depth to prevent excessive computation.
 * Final output:
 *
 * A score is assigned to each move based on the depth of reachable squares.
 * The move leading to the largest free space is considered the best choice.
 *
 * Potential optimizations and improvements:
 * Optimized queue handling to make the BFS faster.
 * Adding opponent-awareness to avoid areas where enemies are likely to trap the bot.
 * Combining it with other heuristics (e.g., A* for path prioritization).
